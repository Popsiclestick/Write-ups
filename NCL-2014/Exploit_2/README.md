Webmin - Exploit 2
========================
## Challenge:

> **Description:** This challenge had us connecting to a server where the following information was shown **[Link to image here].** A flag.php file and a webmin folder containing a config file.
>
> **Goal:** Find the flag for 2000 Points.

## Solution:

Solving this problem was pretty fun. Though the taunt of having flag.php right in front of me was painful. First off I began by looking through the provided files. It was no surprise that flag.php wasn't going to contain the viewable flag. So, onto the next file, webmin. This folder contained a basic webmin config file that provided no real useful information either. So what do. I know that there is a flag.php file somewhere on the server that most likely contains the flag, and that the server is running webmin.

Armed only with that information I figured something else had to be on the server. Bring in good old nmap.
> nmap -Pn [Server IP]

Wooh! Whats that!? snet-sensor-mgmt running on port 10000? Interesting. After giving that a go I found myself at this page [Link to image here]. I started broswing the googles for any default accounts or passwords but I soon found there were none. Better yet the server implemented a timeout mechanism to stop brute forcing.

Well. There _has_ to be another way. Are there any exploits for webmin?? Ah lookie [here](http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/admin/webmin/file_disclosure), this looks interesting. Now given our knowledge of flag.php, our best bet is that it resides in /var/www/. So lets fire it up.

> use auxiliary/admin/webmin/file_disclosure
> set RPATH /var/www/flag.php

Boom! We have a flag!
