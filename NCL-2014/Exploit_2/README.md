Webmin - Exploit 2
========================
## Challenge:

> **Description:** This challenge had us connecting to a server where the following information was shown <Link to image here>. A flag.php file and a webmin folder containing a config file.
>
> **Goal:** Find the flag for 2000 Points.

## Solution:

Solving this problem was pretty fun. Though the taunt of having flag.php right in front of me was painful. First off I began by looking through the provided files. It was no surprise that flag.php wasn't going to contain the viewable flag (definitely would've saved me some time though!). So, onto the next file, webmin. This folder contained a basic webmin config file that provided no real useful information either. So what do. I know that there is a flag.php file somewhere on the server that most likely contains the flag, and that the server is running webmin.

Armed only with that information I figured something else had to be on the server. Bring in good old nmap.
> nmap -Pn <Server IP>

Wooh!?! Whats that!?
